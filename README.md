# Reflection Util
This is a utility class to handle common reflection tasks in Java, such as executing getters and setters or retrieving
specific fields.  This can be useful if you need more dynamic behavior in your project, but have code you want to keep 
in Java.

This class is implemented in Groovy, as it greatly simplifies this kind of thing over vanilla Java.
